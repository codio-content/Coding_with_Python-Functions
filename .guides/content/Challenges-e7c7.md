We're now ready for you to write some challenges to test your new found knowledge of functions.

## Testing your functions
In these challenges, you will write functions that we will call. You can test these out easily directly in your code as we showed in the earlier example.

```python
# caclulate the volume of a cylinder
import math

def volumeCylinder(radius, height):
  v = math.pi * radius * radius * height
  return v

output ('r=10, h=20 => V=' + str(volumeCylinder(10, 20)))
```

Jusy call your function yourself anywhere outside the function as `value = convertField(string1)` does above.

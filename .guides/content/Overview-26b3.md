Functions are eveywhere in programming and for good reason. They are one of the most powerful constructs available.

## Definition

- A function is a piece of code that performs a specific task that is packaged up as a unit. 
- It can be called with inputs
- It can return data

Another way of summing a function up is that you can take code that is often or repetitively needed, package it up and give it a name so you can use it as often as you like and from wherever you like.

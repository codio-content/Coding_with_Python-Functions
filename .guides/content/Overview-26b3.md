Functions are used a great deal in programming, and this is for a good reason. Functions are one of the most powerful constructs available to you as a programmer.

## Definition

- A function is a piece of code that performs a specific task 
- A function is packaged up as a unit. 
- A function can be called with inputs
- A function return data

Code that is often or repetitively needed is neatly packaged and given a name so that it can be used as often as you like from wherever you like in a program.

### Programming Principles

*Information Hiding* is the principle of treating a list of tasks as a single task whilst ignoring the details. Instead of writing all the steps to make tea, I simply think of one step, “make tea.” Functions allow me to create a way to hide multiple steps of a task behind a single step: the function call.

*Modularity* is the process of writing software so that sections can be replaced without affecting other sections. By using functions, the code inside the function can be changed without changing the code outside the function.

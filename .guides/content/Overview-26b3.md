Functions are eveywhere in programming and for good reason. They are one of the most powerful constructs available.

## Definition

- A function is a piece of code that performs a specific task that is packaged up as a unit. 
- It can be called with inputs
- It can return data

Another way of summing a function up is that you can take code that is often or repetitively needed, package it up and give it a name so you can use it as often as you like and from wherever you like.

### Programming Principles

*Information Hiding* is the principle of treating a list of tasks as a single task, ignoring the details. Instead of writing all the steps to make tea, I simply think of one step, “make tea.” Functions allow me to create a way to hide multiple steps of a task behind a single step: the function call.

*Modularity* is the process of writing software so that sections can be replaced without affecting other sections. By using functions, the code inside the function can be changed without changing the code outside the function.
